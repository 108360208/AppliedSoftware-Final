individual 10 Although garments 200 300 each depicted being pairs shorts various concepts disclosed below garments 200 300 also applied other pantstype garments including pants briefs jeans underwear various concepts disclosed below garments 200 300 also applied shirttype garments which cover portion torso area individual 10 extend over arms individual 10 Examples shirttype garments include longsleeved shirts shortsleeved shirts tank tops undershirts jackets coats In some configurations articles apparel incorporating concepts disclosed below garments 200 300 combinations shirttype garments pantstype garments including bodysuits leotards unitards wetsuits In addition articles apparel incorporating concepts disclosed below garments 200 300 have configurations that cover other areas individual 10 such hats helmets arm leg wraps gloves socks footwear example\\nAlthough apparel system 100 worn alone exposed apparel system 100 also worn combination other articles appareleg under over other articles apparel Apparel system 100 also worn combination other pieces equipmenteg athletic protective equipment In general outer garment 200 worn over inner garment 300 thereby positioning outer garment 200 exterior inner garment 300 Whereas inner garment 300 worn contact cover individual 10 outer garment 200 worn contact cover inner garment 300 That inner garment 300 generally positioned between individual 10 outer garment 200 Depending upon various factorseg sport activity weather preferences other articles apparel pieces equipment worna between inner garment 300 individual 10b between garments 200 300 orc exterior outer garment 200 Accordingly configuration apparel system 100 including each individual garments 200 300 manner which apparel system 100 worn individual 10 vary significantly\\nApparel system 100 incorporates various cover components 210 protective components 305 More particularly outer garment 200 includes cover components 210 inner garment 300 includes protective components 305 Although cover components 210 protective components 305 each utilized individually impart padding cushioning otherwise distribute attenuate impact forces thereby imparting protection individual 10 components 210 305 also operate cooperatively impart protection individual 10 For example some cover components 210 overlap extend over otherwise coincide

surface 323 extends generally straight fashion between surfaces 321 322 Pads 313 spaced evenly from each other arranged offset rows Moreover pads 313 generally discrete elements that spaced from each other also connected formed onepiece unit Given that cushioning element 310 depicted having generally pentagonal configuration various pads 313 around perimeter cushioning element 310 exhibit truncated partial configuration Some pads 313 also define apertures 324 that receive elements securing plate element 315 these pad components larger than other pad components 315 variety materials utilized pads 313 including any various materials discussed above pad 213 such polymer foam materials fluidfilled chambers\\nEach pads 313 depicted having same thicknessie distance between surfaces 321 322 which range from one fifty millimeters more when formed from polymer foam material As alternative pads 313 exhibit varying thicknesses For example group pads 313 located central area cushioning element 310 exhibit maximum thickness group pads 313 located around central area exhibit medium thickness group pads 313 located adjacent periphery cushioning element 310 exhibit minimum thickness configuration cushioning element varying thicknesses disclosed US Provisional Patent Application Ser No 61158653 filed 9 Mar 2009 entitled Cushioning Elements For Apparel And Other Products which entirely incorporated herein reference\\nFrame 314 located between each material layers 311 312 In contrast pads 313 frame 314 unsecured each first material layer 311 second material layer 312 frame 314 also unsecured pads 313 This configuration permits frame 314 float otherwise move relative first material layer 311 second material layer 312 pads 313 Frame 314 defines plurality apertures 325 having general shape pads 313 Given this configuration frame 314 extends around between various pads 313 In areas where frame 314 present combination pads 313 frame 314 effectively forms foam layer within cushioning element 310 Although dimensions apertures 325 substantially match dimensions pads 313 frame 314 also formed such that gap extends between edges apertures 325 side surfaces 233 pads 313 Any variety materials discussed above being suitable pads 213 313 also utilized frame 314\\nFrame 314 depicted being located central area cushioning element 310 As alternative frame 314 extenda throughout cushioning element 310 define apertures 325 that extend around all pads 313b around other pads 313 orc through other areas cushioning element 310 Additionally frame 314 extend periphery cushioning element 310 some areas not other areas Accordingly portions cushioning element 310 into which frame 314 extends vary significantly\\nReferring crosssectional views FIGS 16A 16B example frame 314 depicted exhibiting lesser thickness than each pads 313 An advantage this configuration that frame 314 move relative material layers 311 312 thereby enhancing flexibility cushioning element 310 As example frame 314 have thickness approximately two millimeters configuration wherein pads 313 exhibit thickness five millimeters In other configurations thickness frame 314 range from one fifty millimeters more Although frame 314 exhibit lesser thickness than pads 313 frame 314 also thicker than pads 313 variety methods utilized manufacture cushioning element 310 In general methods include bondingeg adhesive thermal bonding each pads 313 material layers 311 312 Examples suitable manufacturing processes disclosed ina US patent application Ser No 12755579 which was filed US Patent Trademark Office 7 Apr 2010 entitled Method Of Manufacturing Cushioning Elements For Apparel And Other Productsb US patent application Ser No 13035570 which was filed US Patent Trademark Office 25 Feb 2011 entitled Cushioning Elements For Apparel And Other Products And Methods Of Manufacturing Cushioning Elements andc US patent application Ser No 13035592 which was filed US Patent Trademark Office 25 Feb 2011 entitled Articles Of Apparel Incorporating Cushioning Elements And Methods Of Manufacturing Articles Of Apparel each which entirely incorporated herein reference\\nPlate element 315 positioned exterior material layers 311 312 pads 313 frame 314 Whereas pads 313 frame 314 located between material layers 311 312 plate element 315 located opposite side first material layer 311 forms portion exterior surface inner garment 300 protective component 305 As described greater detail below plate element 315 has semirigid structure that distributes impact forces over pads 313 impart protection individual 10 another wearer\\nVarious securing elements 326 utilized secure plate element 315 cushioning element 310 Securing elements 326 extend through apertures 327 plate element 315
